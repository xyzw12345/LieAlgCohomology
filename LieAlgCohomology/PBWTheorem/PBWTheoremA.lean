The work on this file might have to stop for a while, as we're now communicating with the group that's working on graded/filtered objects since most constructions seems to be more generally applicable. They'll probably write something of more general usage, and we'll use those APIs after they've finished.

So the current work will be focusing on the other missing things like symmetric algebra and some specific constructions in the proof.
